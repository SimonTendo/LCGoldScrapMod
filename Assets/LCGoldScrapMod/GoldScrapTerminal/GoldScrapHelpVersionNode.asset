    No, my intention
    is to follow the ''official'' release version on Steam, I am not planning on
    updating the mod for beta versions.


    This might introduce bugs, should things
    change in the original game. But otherwise the only difference is that gold scrap
    will not spawn on new moons that have not yet been officially released.


    But
    the mod does support backwards compatability. Certain features introduced in
    new versions of Lethal Company will be checked for their presence, and if they
    are not present, they will simply not be used. So, old versions of the game can
    still use this mod, in case you want to play with other deprecated mods as well.
