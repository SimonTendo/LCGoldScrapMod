    I''ll keep working
    on this mod, so I''ll likely find problems too and try to fix them.


    But
    if you really feel the need to share something, in the Lethal Company Modding
    discord''s mod-releases channel there is a LCGoldScrapMod post. I''ll probably
    see the message and drop by.


    I''ll also keep adding more content, so look
    forward to what this mod has in store for the future!
