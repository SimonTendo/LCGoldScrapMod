    First
    of all, the gold items function the same regardless of how they might look. Gameplay
    will not change, the difference is only cosmetic.


    The difference can be
    caused by three things:

    1) You or the other person has mods that change
    models of items in the game. If anyone has any mod that changes a model, only
    they will see custom placeholder models.


    2) Someone is playing with settings
    that change the models or sounds. These settings can be changed under Edit config
    in the mod manager.


    3) Something broke :(

    But it should fix itself
    if you restart the game. My apologies.
