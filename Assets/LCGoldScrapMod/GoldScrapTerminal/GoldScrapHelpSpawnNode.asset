  displayText: "\"Where can I find gold scrap?\"\n\nBy default, gold scrap will only
    appear on vanilla Lethal Company moons where the original version of that scrap
    appears. \n\nFor example, if an item only spawns on Offense and Dine, even if
    it's very rare for it to spawn there, the gold version of that item also only
    spawns on Offense and Dine. But there is an exception: S+ Levels. On moons with
    a Hazard Level of S+ or higher, ALL gold scrap can appear, meaning gold scrap
    more consistenly spawns there too.\n\nHowever, using the mod manager's Edit config
    settings, you can set what moons you want gold scrap to appear on, how rare it
    is, and even if it should spawn on custom moons. So feel free to take control
    over what you think feels best!\n\n"
