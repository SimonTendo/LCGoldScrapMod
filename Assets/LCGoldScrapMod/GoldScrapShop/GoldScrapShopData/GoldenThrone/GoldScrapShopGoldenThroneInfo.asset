    The ultimate status symbol.


    This exquisite piece of masterful
    furniturenary design represents the blood, sweat, and blood that countless of
    teams of employees have put into trying to collect scrap for the Company. But
    you... you are better than all of them.


    Fully covered in gold, armrests
    for your arms which must be sore from carrying scrap, cushions on the sitting
    area AND backrest. This item is sure to record the achievements your team has
    made into the history books forever, as the greatest ensemble of employees the
    world has ever seen work together!


    Only enough space for one person.
