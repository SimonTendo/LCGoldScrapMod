    These massive rocks of gold have been littered about the Company,
    so we want to get rid of them. They supposedly increase in value over time, but
    they''re worth nothing right now.


    So, you hold on to them for a while,
    see if they indeed become more valuable. And you better bring them back to us
    eventually. The longer you keep us waiting, the higher the risk you all sustain
    too many injuries and lose this rock along with the rest of your scrap!
