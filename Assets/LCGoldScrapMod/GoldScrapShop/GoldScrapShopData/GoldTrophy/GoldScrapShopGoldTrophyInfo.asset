    to purchase and display the Gold Trophy is a sign to all other employees that
    you have made it within the Company. Paying for it will make you feel so special
    that the sheer disbelief of having bought such a prestigious item will send shivers
    down your spine. The transaction alone should get you excited, but seeing the
    receipt and realizing that every credit was worth it should make everything you
    used to have less valuable. \nSo buy it already.\n\n"
