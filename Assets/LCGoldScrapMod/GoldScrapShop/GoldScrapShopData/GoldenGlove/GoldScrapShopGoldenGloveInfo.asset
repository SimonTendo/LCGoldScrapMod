    arts of COMP-FU:


    1 - ANNIHILATE

    Launch a mass of power that can inflict
    fatal damage the closer you are to your opponent.


    2 - CONFISCATE

    Do
    not go to scrap, reach a state of mind where you can grab it from anywhere your
    aim may reach.


    3 - DEVASTATE

    Forbidden on 79 planets, this art will
    create an opening for action by disarming your foe.
