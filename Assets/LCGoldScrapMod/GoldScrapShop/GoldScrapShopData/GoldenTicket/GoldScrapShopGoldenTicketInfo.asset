    This lucky ticket allows you to keep all* your items when being
    teleported.


    When using a normal Teleporter, hold a Ticket in your inventory
    and you shall be brought back to the ship with all your items still in your hands.

    And
    when using an Inverse Teleporter, as long as one teleported person has a Ticket,
    everyone should keep their items!


    *Ticket itself is destroyed upon use.
