    A crown fit to put you above those weak co-workers.


    This
    magnificent headpiece will, above all else, show your distinction within society,
    which by and large already expositions a splendid caricature. Furthermore, the
    collected monetary value of whomever is wearing this crown will translate into
    the value of its fine materials.


    And at last, and most importantly, to
    ensure to an absolute level of elite precision that those peasants do not try
    to dethrone you from your royal status, we superglue it to your head.
