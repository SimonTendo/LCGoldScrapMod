  - This misshapen statue of a dog appears to boost your luck. Teams that have purchased
    it have stated that they found increased amounts of golden items, but only on
    certain days.
  - "\"Hmph. Na\xEFve human... You truly think you may approach a deity such as I?\n\nDo
    you know no shame? Talking in that pipsqueaky voice. Feeding me delicious treats.
    Even trying to... (tsk)- 'pet' me.\n\nDo you not see my claws? Do you not fear
    what might happen to you should you... attempt to steal my treasure? I am sure
    such impure thoughts have crossed your mind, you shameless skyscraper. And I
    am sure you don't know what you're dealing with.\n\nYou should know of the fortunes
    I guard... The infinite mountains of gold far beyond your simple comprehension.
    The sheer VERACITY... of my POWER!!\n\nYou... you are nothing more than a VESSEL!
    Collecting scrap fo- was that a fly? *ahem* I mean... Collecting scrap for that
    shell of corruption. You are as hollow-minded as the empty breeze that carries
    the cherry blossom petals that dare not caress my sacred fur.\n\nI will make
    sure tha-- FLY!!\n\nAck! I mean! I will make sure that you shall know just a
    sliver of the fortunes I hold!\nFor as long as I stand tall within your ship
    walls, you shall be blessed.\n\nBlessed with days upon which the gold you seek
    shall flow in spades! Blessed with a luck found only once every nine lives! Blessed...
    with ME!!\n\nFOR HEAR ME! \nI AM THE BLESSING OF THE WORLD!!\nAND I WILL BLESS
    THE WORLD WITH MY FORTUNES!!!\n\nNNYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaa.........\"\n\n(it
    got distracted by the fly and ran off)"
  - "\"Hah! Fool! Are you trying to contain me? \n\nDo you think your ship's storage
    will REALLY stop my overwhelming abilities?! This... This cage. It is only temporary.
    \n\nI shall claw at its door as if it were an ancient warrior. \nI am going to
    yell meows of discontent that cry like storm's thunder. \nI will look through
    the little holes with the largest, cutest pupils that you cannot resist! \n\nAnd
    do not think my golden powers will waver... I shall keep unleashing my forces
    of fortune upon this world. Keep making the gold of the world flow in spades.
    Keep delivering gifts unto you that... that you- you shall be THANKFUL FOR!!
    \nIt will just... happen less often. \n\nSo please, comfort yourself with the
    knowledge that you may have stowed me away. For now... \n\nNyaha! Nyahahaha!!
    NYAHAHAAaaaaawwn...\" \n\n(it yawned and laid down to sleep)"
