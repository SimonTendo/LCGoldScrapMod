    Current Credits Card selling price:

    [goldScrapCreditsCardSellingPrice]


    We
    just fired a team of employees who still had Company Credits on their terminal.
    So, we are putting this leftover money to good use by introducing the Credits
    Card Gold Program(tm)!


    This allows you to buy back and sell however many
    unspent Credits were left before the moment of being fired. Additionally, all
    the team''s overtime bonuses are included in the card''s value, and the card
    can even go on sale, meaning you could profit off their hard work at a very low
    cost.


    So buy low, sell high, and make the new quota!
