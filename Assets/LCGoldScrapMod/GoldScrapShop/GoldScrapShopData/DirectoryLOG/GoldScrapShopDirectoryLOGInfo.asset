    Here at the Company, we believe wisdom should be passed on
    between generations. Therefore, we have brought back a retired, yet experienced
    employee. This veteran has a nose for gold, having brought back more valuable
    scrap than most teams combined.


    Use the ''SCAN'' command to see how much
    gold scrap is on the planet, its value, and a score indicating how worthwhile
    it is.


    Additionally, using the command ''DLOG'', he will be able to offer
    extra help about the gold items, such as its distance from any entrance, whether
    it is two-handed, a tool, or another noteworthy piece of knowledge. Simply filter
    out important information.
