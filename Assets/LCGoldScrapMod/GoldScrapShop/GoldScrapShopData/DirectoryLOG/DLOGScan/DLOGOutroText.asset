  - 'Eh? Still here? Heh, heh, you remind me of one particularly lazy coworker I
    had to deal with once.


    Guy always stayed on camera duty back at the ship.
    We ended up calling him Square-Eye Steve, because of how he wouldn''t look away
    from that damned screen for 20 seconds.


    Did you know they tried to write
    that into law? Looking away from your screen? Pfeh heh heh! Ridiculous, am I
    right? Politicians can''t stop blib-blab-blubbering about each other on their
    devices yet they wanna take screens away from us poor down-trodden middle-class
    laymen.


    I tell ya, I''ve seen more empathy coming from the dead eyes of
    a Coil-head than I have from the average politician ''round these parts of space.


    Anyways,
    I''ve probably said enough to get me in trouble already... Now go and make yourself
    useful using my advice, so that bloomin'' Company doesn''t cut my retirement
    short.'
  - "Hmmm, that smell. I must say... *snifffffff* How long has it been since I smelled
    the strangely sweet scent of that stupendously sparkly scrap? A year? Two? Five?
    Ten? One hundred? \n\nFeels like it's all just a blur, yet it also feels like
    I last collected scrap only yesterday... Maybe ehh... maybe my age is just catchin'
    up to me... Or- well, heh, let's hope not, eh kiddo? I wanna stick around until
    you finish your time at the company, that's a promise! Heh, heh!"
  - 'Ermm... are you... still here? Was my advice to go out into the big, wide world
    not enough reason for you to get up and move? Don''t you fear that dreaded disciplinary
    process? I''ve heard they send ya into space, you know!


    Or do you simply
    enjoy MY company so much? Eh heh- Ah heh heh heh heh! Get it? My company? As
    opposed to the big scary corporation-company we''re all workin'' for? Ehhh, you
    gotta keep morale up on the job, you know.


    Ah- you know what keeps morale
    up? Singing! Really, try it! Go out there and hum-rum-dee-dum yourself a melody
    to lift the mood! If ya got a real treasure of a team your colleagues will sing
    right along with ya, aheheheh!


    We used to do it on higher quotas, singin''.
    And let me tell you, we had the grandest time doin'' it. Turkey in the Straw,
    Bananas, Groovy Gold... We knew ''em all! And I hope those blasted monsters got
    some of those tunes stuck in their heads too, heh heh! Serves ''em right, eeheeheehee!'
  - 'Ah, but, by the way... Ehh, I uh... don''t know how things have changed over
    the course of time, clearly, but ehhh... We didn''t have as much gold back in
    the day, as there seems to be now.


    That''s how I got this nose of mine.
    Had to reeeaaally practice it to be able to pick up that scent. Helped me stay
    at the company for so long too, eh heh heh. Nowadays there can be so much of
    that gold, oh I tell ya, your nose will be slapped silly from all the smells.


    So
    I guess ehh... I guess I mean to say... don''t feel bad. That store might be
    telin'' ya to pass wisdom from one generation to another, but really, we just
    hadn''t been outplayed by our own devices yet. Just try to do the best you can,
    no one''s gonna think less of ya.


    And if anything, I believe in you, kiddo.
    Eh heh!'
  - '...Hm? Still need something? Ehh, I''m afraid this old shnoz of mine can only
    really do its "thing", as you kids would say, once every day. Smellin''''s a
    business, but the demand heavily outweighs the supply, eeheh heh heh heh.


    Ehh...
    Ah, speakin''-a which, did ya know I was top of the class, back in my day? Yeahhh
    heh heh, this old dog was quite the bag of brains, I tell ya, heh heh heh. Got
    top grades and all. All the guys were jealous of me, heeheeheehee!


    Ahhhhh,
    but, ya know, it embarrasingly took me way too long to learn that, ehh... Just
    having smarts wouldn''t make me more likeable, you know? Got too cocky durin''
    job interviews... Only place that wanted me was a store that just needed boxes
    lifted, heheh.


    What I''m ehh... trying to say is, is... Be a nice person,
    you hear? Do things people will thank you for. Don''t just do the things you
    yourself wanna do. You''re in this universe together, and you''re not gonna do
    yourself a favor by makin'' enemies, eheh heh heh!'
  - 'Or- oh, ehh, young''in, ehm... I- eggh... I, eh, wanted to ask ya somethin''.
    I- ehh... I know you wanna go collect scrap already, but ehhh... Can I ask you
    something a bit more personal?


    See, I was wondering... Ehh... You know,
    back in my day, I worked in retail... Liftin'' boxes. It''s, ehh, hehe- It''s
    how I met my lovely wife, eeheheh. And, ehh, ya know, it paid well. Nothin''
    this old fart could complain about, hehehe! Ehm, but, ya know, stubborn young
    fart sure did complain...


    Ehm, wait... I was- Oh! Oh yeah, I was asking
    you something. See, this is how you young people earn your money. How you spend
    your time. But, ehhh... see, I didn''t want to lift boxes my whole life. I always
    wanted to become a teacher of sorts... Help the younger generation grow up.


    Ehm...
    Heh, and- Hehe... I guess the company sort of granted me that wish, by lettin''
    me teach you kids what I''ve learned during my time collectin'' scrap. It''s
    just that... Ehhhh... Collecting scrap I did because of the lifting boxes-thing.
    Not, eh... because of the teaching-thing.


    So, ehhh... I guess what I''m
    trying to say is, eh... Once your season at the company is over, and ya don''t
    have anyone you still wanna earn bucketloads of salary for... Follow your dreams,
    kiddo. This old man believes in ya...'
  - 'Eh? Did ya not hear me? Go, young''in! Time''s a wastin''! Reading the ramblings
    of this decrepit bag of skin might cost ya your hide, if the monsters reach the
    facility floor before you do.


    And... Ehh... I don''t wanna lose you, kid.
    Seeing you all running around like headless chickens, it, ehh... Well, ya know...
    It reminds me of the old days. My- ehh... "Golden days", you could say, hehe...


    I,
    ehhhh... *ehem* I... Eh... Hehhhh... Oh, for bloomin''''s sake I can''t get it
    out my throat, hehhhh. I- I-... I miss those days! Laughed some of my biggest
    laughs. Had the biggest of thrills this stale blood can remember. But above all...
    I met some of the kindest people I knew...


    And- and- and... I lost ''em!
    They''re gone! They- they deceased on the workfloor! By those- those godfors-
    ehh... by those monsters! So go already! I don''t wanna have to mourn another
    lost soul. Not at my old age...'
  - 'Hheehhhhhhh... Or- Ah, you know, kiddo. I, ehhh... I hope this doesn''t sound
    insultin'' to you, but... I enjoy the peace and quiet while everyone''s in the
    facilty. The peace and quiet on the ship, I mean.


    Ya- hehehe, maybe you
    young''ins might have a joke too, about the person at "home" on camera duty,
    just... hehe, just eatin'' outta his nose all day long! Eeheheheh! While- heh,
    while the rest of ya is sufferin'' those bloomin'' monsters inside the facility.
    Eeheehee!


    Heh, yeahhh... That was a joke already all the way back in my
    day! Hehehe! Ehhh, so, heh, if ya wanna experience some of that peace and quiet
    too, just ehh... just pretend you''re reading somethin'' reeeaaal useful on this
    computer, and just... stay behind for a day! Ehhhheheheheheh! *ehem!*'
  - 'Hrrmmm, ahhh... Feels good, havin'' helped.........


    Hm? Still here? Ah,
    I was just, ehhh... I wanted to get some shut-eye... I... I''m tired. Ehh, don''t
    get me wrong. I appreciate helping you kids, but, ehh... I''m just... I''m not
    as energetic as I used to be...


    I ehh... I was already starting to get
    on in age during my time on the job. My previous experience with liftin'' heavy
    retail cargo sure helped my old body stay in shape. Or... ehh, at least, in shape
    enough to carry scrap too, but...


    It was clear I wouldn''t have many quotas
    left in me before I could finally sign off on my contract at the company. And
    it''s, ehh... I don''t know why I''m back. I just wanted to spend my final days
    in peace with my lovely wife... So, ehh, please... Allow me to at least have
    some peace, while I''m here...'
  - '....


    Hmm- mhm, hum dum, tadum hmmm... Mmm, badum mhm hm-hm hm-hmmm...
    Eh? Ah, you eavesdropping on this old fart now, kiddo? Eheheh, well, good thing
    I did nothin'' incriminatin'', heh heh heh!


    I was ehhh... I was just humming
    a little tune from back in my day. A little jaunty tune we used to sing to lift
    the mood with while on the job. Somethin'' I ehh... something that- heh, something
    that we thought we could teach those scrap-hoarding bugs to sing too, eeheeheeheehee!


    We-
    ehh... we didn''t, of course, hee heeheee! We must have looked like right fools,
    ehhhhheheheheh- heh- *ehem* *cough**cough* Ehhh, ow... Ehm... Anyway, kiddo,
    try to keep your spirits up while on the job. By singin'', dancin'', pointin''.
    Whatever ya like, just enjoy it! Heehee, eh, hehhhh...'
