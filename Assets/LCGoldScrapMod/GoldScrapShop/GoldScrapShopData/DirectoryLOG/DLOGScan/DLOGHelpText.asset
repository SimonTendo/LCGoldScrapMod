  - '*sniff* *sniff* Ah, that thing. Who could forget such a classic item? Ya find
    ''em everywhere, they''re light, still sell for a decent price. Just something
    to put a little smile on any employee''s face.


    You know, when we first
    found a gold version of that giant screw, we actually didn''t even know there
    were gold objects to begin with. We were com-plete-ly unaware, heh heh heh!


    Heh
    heh, had to contact HQ and everything. Ask if it was of any significance. Heh,
    I don''t think the guy on the phone ever got such an earful, heeheeheehee!


    Ahhh,
    that really brings back memories. Now, make sure you bring it back, alright?
    Best of luck, youngster!'
  - '*snifff--* Ack! Just smelling that makes my ears hurt.


    Hm? How that''s
    possible? Well, it''s... I don''t know. I guess I just remember the earpiercing
    sound of that thing, and associate the smell of the object with it.


    But
    this is no time for a biology lesson, there''s scrap to get. Now go! And don''t
    start blastin'' that thing when you get back to the ship, please. '
  - '*sniff* *sniff* *snifffffff* Oh! Oh! Oh hoh hoh hoh ho! Gold! Gold! And not
    just ordinary gold! Something worth oodles upon oodles of coins! Something to
    fill your coffers with until they''re burstin'' at the seams!


    I can smell
    the weight of something so valuable too, so take care to protect whoever''s tasked
    with bringing that back with your life, because you''re gonna want to take it
    back, no questions asked!


    And also, heh... This item ehh... Reminds me
    of my lovely wife, heh heh... But! *ehem* Find it, plan your trip back, prioritize
    the safety of the carryer, and you''ll be swimmin'' in gold, kiddo! Heeheehee!'
  - 'AH! -oh? Oh, it''s just a gold version. Thought it was one of those unholy fakes.


    I
    once lost a perfectly good man to a normal version of one of those things. Poor
    lad had been workin'' himself to the bone. He just wanted a little joke, wear
    it, and scare the pants off the interns.


    Well, he managed to scare us,
    alright. But... He, ehh... Had to pay for it with his life, I fear...


    Ehh-
    *ehem*, anyways. That gold version should be perfectly safe to wear, don''t you
    worry, kiddo!'
  - '*sniff* *snifflesniffsniff* Hm, not a bad find. Alright, young''in, I know you
    love blarin'' loud sounds. Unless you don''t, and don''t have an accursed ringin''
    in your ears, in which case... Good going, kiddo! Eheh, heh, heh!


    Now,
    erm... where was I... ehhh... Oh yeah, the item. Listen, kid. That thing''s so
    bloomin'' loud, you can hear from it anywhere. Kinda like that ehh... that ehmmm...
    ah, the horn. That horn-thing. On your ship.


    Just like that horn, ya can
    use this scrap to send a sound to your team. Maybe it means "safety". Maybe one
    person will never drop it, so if ya do hear it go off, that''s a sign something''s
    up with ''em. Maybe it means ya gotta pee, I dunno.


    Ogh, now I need to
    loo again... Look, you go get that noise-bomb, while I try to get this sorry
    bum to a bathroom. If I could ever... find one around here...'
  - '*sniiiIIFF!!* WHA- Whaheeyy, ehh heh heh heh heh heh! That thing! Wowie!


    Ah,
    ehm, that outburst must seem ridiculous, eheheh... But, kid, trust me. That thing''s
    got some uses to say "sir" to. For one, once you take it back to the ship, turn
    the lights off, and... well... try to find the switch again. Or make your co-workers
    try to find it usin'' this thing, eheheh!


    But it gets better, ohhh it gets
    better, you trust me, young''in. If ya got the statue of that oversized guinnea
    pig, she''ll actually help ya find all the fortunes she keeps ravin'' about.


    And
    lastly, the mines... Ohh hoh hoh hoh, does one yearn for the mines with this
    thing in hand, ehehe! In short, get this thing, kiddo. And don''t sell it! Lest
    ya wanna kick yourself for leaving so much money behind, eeheheheh!'
  - 'Eh...? Ah, this thing. A must-have, really. Managed to save my skin from those
    nasty Spiders and Thumpers more often than this dusty gray mass can recall.


    Listen,
    ehh... I don''t know exactly where it is, but if you manage to bring it back,
    you''ll have a really valuable tool on your hands. That thing deals a wallop
    unlike any other. So chop, chop, unless I "beat" you to it, ehe heh heh!'
  - '*sniff* Oh? *snifffff* Oh! OH! GOLD! Gold, gold, gold!! Ah, ahaha! Gold! Gold!
    More valuable gold than the mind can grasp! Gold richer than a million wishes!
    Gold worth the price of a thousand romances!


    Gold more valuable than anything
    you''ll find ''round these parts of space! Gold more heavy than the toughest
    space candy! Gold more gold than gold can be!


    This, kiddo, is not just
    gold. This is the opportunity of a lifetime! Its weight might drive down today''s
    score, but it''s somethin'' that you can carry with one hand, is worth bloomin''
    much, and is so, SO rare...


    You''ll be kickin'' yourself for the rest of
    your old days I ya don''t bring it back, sonny! Now go. Go! Time''s a wastin''!'
  - 'D''aww, who doesn''t love that little guy? Even in gold form it''s got the most
    proud little pose of all those awful monsters.


    You know, I''d actually
    make it a point to keep those oversized insects as friends. Eh- not that I ever
    lost any men to them before that point, I mean. But I do think my peace mission
    is how we never got into fights with ''em.


    And hey, who knows... Maybe
    getting a gold version of themselves makes ''em like you too, heh heh! Now, *ehem*...
    "Bug" off, heeheehee!'
  - "*sn-* Blegh! That supersized kindergartener never was one for personal space,
    heh? Its gold version is bloomin' heavy too, so it just seems like all it wants
    is to get up in your face. \n\nBut hey, it's actually so dense ya can even use
    it as a makeshift mountain. And just like a mountain, ya can climb it or hide
    behind it, never darin' to take the first step... Ehhh, but ya gotta collect
    it first, heh heh heh..."
  - '*sniff* *sniff* Oh. Oh no...


    Listen, kiddo, you know coilheads, right?
    ...If- if ya don''t, well, gods in the sky bless your innocent intern soul. But
    if you do, ya know how to deal with this scrap, too.


    Your worst enemies
    will be your co-workers, so try to coordinate, preferably without ''em leavin''
    ya in the dust, eheheh!'
  - '*sniff* Ahh-HA! Now here''s somethin'' useful!


    Young''in, if my nose is
    correct. Which- *sniff* *sniff*... well, I sure hope it is. But if you get this
    scrap, don''t be too afraid to take a hit. It''s called a "guardian" for a reason,
    eh heh heh!


    Now, show me that this old nose is still worth some salt, and
    scrap away! Eeheeheh!'
  - '*sniff* Is that...? *sniiiiff* It is!


    Ah, just smellin'' that tool again
    reminds me of the days when I had to work with pranksters who''d pull the apparatus
    out of its socket and turn the whole bloomin'' facility to darkness before I''d
    even seen the second hallway...


    Those brats would sometimes even go bowling
    with the darn thing. Can you believe it? Bowling?! With an apparatus? Ridiculous!
    That thing''s worth a pretty penny and they treat it like a toy!


    Ehh, I
    wish they didn''t have to... Well, I guess this is one job where you can''t goof
    off, or you won''t have your candle burnin'' long enough to be sorry.


    Uhmm,
    anyways, no more darkness for you if you get that gold, though! Heh, heh...'
  - '*sniff-* Pfeh! Heh! Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh! What a joke! Eh heh heh...


    Ahh,
    alright, kiddo, this thing is not worth your time. It''s heavy, not worth much,
    gets smitten by the bloomin'' gods in the sky. Enough reasons for a veteran to
    tell ya to avoid it. Heh, heh...


    It''s still gold, don''t get me wrong.
    But even the normal version of this plate of junk is considered a waste of time
    among employees. Get it if ya want, but don''t feel bad for leaving it behind.
    Now, happy scrappin''!'
  - 'Hm? What is-? What is that? Is my nose playing tricks on me? I smell something,
    or... do I? Ehhh, you know, at my age, you start taking for granted that... that
    things just stop working.


    But this... I''ve smelt it before, and it''s
    such... such a strong scent of gold. So strong even my co-workers could smell
    it sometimes. But... always seems like only one of ''em could smell it at a time...
    though...


    Eh, ohh, my head... I... I should probably lie down, get some
    rest. Ehh... Please, leave me be, if I may...'
  - "What- What's that? Is that... Is that even an object? I think that's just a
    livin' bein'. Or... used to be, anyway. Whoever decided to turn that thing to
    gold has a sick sense of humor, I tell ya. \n\nTry to bring it back so we can
    hopefully bring some peace to its poor innocent little soul, will ya?"
  - 'Hrmm... Another useful tool, becoming nothing more than a mere prank in the
    hands of overplayful and underpaidful employfuls. Eheh... those aren''t ehh,
    real words, heh heh...


    *ehem* A- anyways, this little thing is normally
    a toy for your ship, but you''ll see soon enough why ya shouldn''t treat it like
    a toy in the facility, kiddo. You''ll be drivin'' your whole team up the wall
    if ya get too playful with it.


    Ehhh... Heh, heh... I just realized that,
    eh... that might only motivate you more, heh? Hrm... Well ehhh, do with it what
    ya want. Just don''t say I was complicit in any practical jokes, alright young''in?
    Heh, heheh, heh...'
  - '*sni-* Yikes! That smell brings back memories. And unpleasant ones, at that.


    Listen
    up, you''re still young and spry, so what you should- ...what? You think you''re
    not young anymore? Oh stop blabbering and listen to this stuck old man''s advice.
    I''m tryin'' to help here...


    Now, what you should do, is... Ehh... If you
    want this gold scrap, you''re going to need to avoid two-handed items. If possible,
    try to drop it, pick up another item, and then pick it up again.


    I''d also
    advice against use of the jetpack. Anything to keep your hands free. Hm? Why
    I''m sayin'' all this? Oh, I guess... I guess you''ll find out, once you find
    it for yourself. But don''t forget my advice out there!'
  - "*sniff* *sniff* Eh? I don't think I've ever encountered something like this
    in my time... This gold item must be either really new-fangled, or something
    so hidden away in the back of space that I never found it.\n\nAfraid I don't
    have much more to say than that, kiddo. It's too technermalogically new for this
    wrinkly old nose to smell. \n\nMaybe you've encountered somethin' like it for
    yourself. In that case, it probably functions similarly too, so use your own
    knowledge out in the field, ya hear? Don't just rely on this saggy bag of skin,
    now off with ya!"
  - '*sni-* Oh, don''t got much time to be explainin'' this one. So, listen up, I''ll
    keep this brief, kiddo. Bring this scrap back ASAP, understood? It''ll keep losing
    value until it reaches your ship walls. Now, ready... Go! Eheheh!'
  - '*sn-* Egh! Bomb!


    Ahh, ehhhh... Ohhhh... Okay. Erm... Young''in, there''s
    some gold out there. But please promise me you treat it with care, alright? I
    don''t wanna see you blow out your candle too soon.


    I, ehh... I heard of
    a team once... They just barely had enough to make quota. Leader of the group
    would finally get to see his children again too, but... Ehhhh, the prankster
    of the group thought it''d be funny to... Well...


    Eh- *ehem* So! Don''t
    you dare play any tricks either, you hear? The fact that it''s a tool might drive
    up today''s score, but that thing''s toggle is the only button you should press!
    You can use its detonation in a chase, but remember that ehh... that it''s still
    a bomb! Please...'
  - "Aha... Aaahhhaaaaa!! Almost forgot how valuable this thing is, heh heh heh!\n\nListen
    kid, by the smell of it, this- wait... *sniff* *sniff* Yeah, must be... This
    thing will save your hide, but ya gotta work for it.\n\nIt's like the original
    version ya might be used to. You know, ehh... From the, ehh... The store. The
    computer store. That you're readin' this on, too. That computer.\n\nEhhmmm...
    oh dear, I ehh... lost my... train of thought... Ehh anyways, it's useful, I
    can smell that. But only if you take care of it. \n\nThat- ehh, that's good advice
    in general, kiddo! Take care of your stuff. That way, you can keep using it far,
    faarrrr into your old days. So, ehhh, yeah... Reuse it... Hehe..."
  - '*sniff* *sniff?* Ehhh, I''m eh.. I''m not smellin'' anything ''round here. No
    gold, at least. There''s probably plenty else for you to find, but it won''t
    be coated in gold, I''m afraid...


    But, ehh... go out there and get collectin''!
    Normal scrap is scrap too, ya hear?'
  - '*sniff* *sniff?* *snuff!* Pfeh, nothin''! None. Zero. Zilch. Zoopdeewoop.


    Listen,
    kiddo, there''s no gold. Least not that I can smell. So ehhh... I''m sorry. Today
    will be a completely mundane day at work. I mean... At this job... Heh heh, there''s
    never a dull moment at this job, eh? Heh heh heh...


    Now, ehh... Alright.
    Off you go. This old man can''t help you anymore, now...'
  - 'Hm. I don''t smell anythin''. Looks like ya gotta find whatever else ya can,
    kiddo, hehehe...


    Ehh, by the way, have I ever told the story of when we
    first found one of those gold items? Well, at first, we didn''t even know there
    was gold, ehhh... And theh eh... then we were made very keenly aware, heeheehee!


    Yeah!
    Hehehe! The company was mad with greed, hehehehe! Ehehe... Heh... Ehm... I, ehh...
    Don''t tell ''em I said that... I don''t-... I don''t know exactly remember how
    they got me to come back here... We were never on great terms, so just... Ehh,
    make sure they don''t get mad at ya... Now go.'
  - "*sniff*\n\nHm...\n\n*sniiiiiiiff* *sniff* *sniff*\n\nHmmmmmmm...\n\nThere's...
    definitely something... But is it worth much? ...No, I wouldn't say so. You'll
    probably find some nice goodies, and I encourage you to bring it back, if you
    can. \n\nBut I'd also advice you to keep your eyes open and look for your regular
    paraphernalia as well. Can't have ya returnin' with empty hands just because
    I led you on with the promise of gold, now, can we?\n\nBut there's still something,
    so chop chop!"
  - '*sniff* *sniff* That''s... *sniff* That''s gold, alright. The faintness of it
    tells me it''s not gonna be much, but, ehh... Collect this, and ya got a nice
    day''s worth of work on your hands. Heh heh...


    Ehm... But... Yeah. It''s
    gold. Just nothin'' to write home about... But ehh, don''t let that get ya down.
    You got this! Now show that company who''s boss! Ehehe!'
  - 'Oooh! Yeahh, that''s the smell of something nice. *sniff* *sniff* Kiddo, this
    gold is promising. Nothing that will net ya an entire quota, but somethin'' worth
    a day''s worth of other junk.


    It may not be a large amount of money if
    you were goin'' to expensive planets for this, but remember that this is still
    rare, ya hear? It won''t be easy to find, so thank the stars whenever you do
    find somethin''!'
  - "*sniffff* Hmmmm. Young'in, the smell of today's gold is present. Not ehhhh...
    faint. Not faint. But also not somethin' to jump for joy for. \n\nUsin' your
    trusty computer scan you can see a score of whether it'll be worth your time,
    so see what your priorities are for yourself. But ehh... try to jump for joy
    anyways, it's still gold after all, eheheh!"
  - 'Oh. Oh ho ho. Now this seems promising. I''m smelling not just gold. But something
    worth a pretty penny too.


    I''m not quite sure where it all is, but if you
    manage to find it, expect a decent pay-out.


    Here, I''ll make a little note
    of it in your computer''s scan, that should be roughly how much all that shiny
    gold is worth. Now, off you go.'
  - '*sniff* *sniff* *sniff* Hmmmmmmhhm. That''s more like it. Kiddo, what I''m smellin''
    today is somethin'' worth collectin''. It''s a fair harvest, should ya manage
    to bring it all back. So go out there and make this old man proud! Ehhhehehehehehe-
    *ehem*!'
  - '*sniff* *sniff* Ah- Ah-wee-hee! Now that''s startin'' to look like a decent
    pay-out!


    Kiddo, the amount of gold on this is planet is somewhat on the
    rare side, so don''t take your chances now. The value of today''s gold is already
    worth a quota an intern would work days for, so try to get it all! Heehee!'
  - '*sniffffFFF!!* Ah! Now that''s promisin''! Young''in, it''s time to stop bumblin''
    about and start treatin'' yourself like a real employee. Or ehhhh... At least
    a ehh... a part-timer.


    Eh... Where was I? Ehm- oh! Yes! Gold! Young''in,
    today''s gold is worth a real whopper, so I advice- eh... No, I- *ehem*... I
    implore you to collect it all! Eh heh heh!


    But, ehh... jokes aside... It
    really is lookin'' promisin'', young''in. I know ya love hearing me talk, but
    ya gotta know when to bumble and when to rumble. And the time to rumble is now!
    Eeeheeheeheehee!'
  - '*sni-* *-iiiiifffff* Yippers! Now this is a very respectable sum of cash. Listen
    up, youngsters, there''s gold on this planet. And something nearing half a thousand,
    no less!


    Get all of today''s gold and you''ll be golden for- oh, *ehem*
    pun not intended, heh, heh, heh...


    Ehhh... where was I, eh... Oh yeah,
    gold. Lots of it. Valuable, too. Ehm... Ehe heh... Completely lost my train of
    thought, heh... eh...


    ...Uhhh, yeah- Uhm, good luck, kiddo!'
  - '*sniff* Oh! *sniff* *sniff* *sniff* Now that''s-! *sniff* *sniff* That''s a
    smell to love! *sniff* *sniff* *sniff* Eeheheheh-! *sniff* *sniff* *sniff* *sniff*
    *sniff* *sniff* *sniff* *sniff* *sniff* *sniff* *sniff*


    Ack! Erm- Sorry!
    Sorry! I got com-plete-ly carried away there... It''s just... *sniff* Kiddo,
    today''s gold is lookin'' real, real promisin''! it''s worth a lot, so scan with
    your terminal, scan with your helmet, scan every nook and cranny, and start smellin''
    that gold too! Eeheeheeheeheehee- *sniff*'
  - '...ow- ...ow-- WOWIE!! Cripes! That is a very large amount, easily worth more
    than half a thousand!


    I- I''ll take note of it in your computer''s scan,
    see the exact value there. It''s okay if you can''t bring ALL of it back, it
    is a hefty sum of money, after all. But you''ve already gotten this far, I believe
    ya can get even further now.


    Now... best of luck, young''in!'
  - '*sniff* Ah! *sniff* Ah, ahah! Gold! *sniff* Gold, gold gold gold!


    Kiddo,
    ya... ya gotta listen reeeaaal careful now! There''s gold here. Worth a reeeaaal
    big amount, too! Ehehehe!


    Trust me, you''re gonna want to collect this.
    There''s-... *sniff* *sniff* There''s so much worth here, it''s what we used
    to call a "harvest", in my teams. Eheheh, I, ehh... I usually popularized that
    term, eheeheeheehee!


    But really, young''in, this is the kinda harvest you''re
    gonna want to get back. Even if you only get just part of the total, you''ll
    still have a few hundred worth for your quota just from gold alone.


    So,
    stop bumblin'' around and go! Go! Go go go go go- *ehem* *cough* *cough!* *cough!*
    *ehem...*'
  - '*sniff* *sniff* *sniff*


    Myeah, there''s gold here. And it looks like ya
    can put it all in your pockets too. So I hope ya got deep pockets in those new-fangled
    suits, kiddo, eh, heh, heh! Now go and fill those coffers!'
  - 'Hrm? Hmm... Mm! Young''in, lemme tell ya, the gold I''m smellin'' today is not
    a bad haul at all, eheh, heh, that rhymes! "Haul at all"... Ehee hee heh!


    Ehh...
    *ehem* But, ehh, what I mean is... Today''s gold looks to be small enough to
    take with ya in your pockets, nothin'' that fills your hands. So, if anything,
    don''t be afraid to prioritize other items for your two-handed carryin'' work.


    I''ve
    heard youngsters nowadays ehh... Don''t wanna be told what to do in minute detail
    but ehhhh, listen to an old man''s advice, even just sometimes, yeah? Maybe I
    really can help ya, heh, heh...'
  - '*sniff* *sniff* Hmm. Smell''s like it''s just small items today, kiddo. But
    ehh... that makes me wonder. What''d the downside of that be?


    See, the
    secret to my success was planning... Know what to expect, get in and get scrap,
    and then leave before the facility gets uninhabitable. It ehh... it worked, heheheh...


    But...
    Ehm... What I wanna say is... One-handed items... You know, "out of sight, out
    of mind". Make sure to remember their weight and conductivity if things do start
    gettin'' dangerous, so you know when to get out, and how.


    Got that, young''in?
    Then scrap! Ehehehe!'
  - '*sniff...* Eh, you know what I just realized... Am I really "lucky" to have
    such a nose? Ehh don''t get me wrong, it''s nice. And ehh, right now I smell
    gold that''s gonna fill your hands, I mean.


    But it''s just... isn''t that
    too convenient? I can smell minute details like that, incredible, I know. But...
    why must the company make me use it like this? Was there no other technology
    feasible for detecting this?


    Ehhh... maybe there is, and the company''s
    doin'' this to keep me company on you young''ins'' ship. But... eghh... sometimes
    it feels like they''re using me like some sort of technology too... It scares
    me...


    Ehm- *ehem* well now, that''s enough of that, heh, heh. There''s
    gold out there, so good luck! Off ya go! Don''t- don''t tell on me! Heh, heh...'
  - '*sniff* *Sniff* *SNIFF*


    Agh! Big, ehh... stuff today! Big items! At least
    one of these items is gonna give you a literal handful to worry about. So if
    you wanna get whatever''s so valuable, make sure to keep some space free in your
    hands.


    Today''s score should also be impacted by the size of the items,
    so get going! Before you''ve got a handful of me on your hands, eheheheh!'
  - 'Ahh, that''s a hearty aroma... Erm- *ehem*... That must weird, when you consider
    we''re talkin'' about, ehhh... inedible matter, heh heh...


    But take it
    from this tastebudless troublemaker- Or, ehm... At least I... used to be, a troublemaker,
    back in my day, heh heh heh.


    Oh- but- ehm... What I mean is, I can smell
    how large these items are, which makes their smell larger too, ya know? ...Ehhhhh,
    I ehh... probably sound ridiculous... Ehhmm, you just go. Try to not embarass
    yourself...'
  - '*sn-* Ah, that was fast, barely had to breathe deep to smell that. Which must
    mean it can''t be far away either...


    So I''m a-guessing you won''t have
    to search long either. Look near any entrances you can get in and out of, the
    gold should be close to that. Now, ta-ta! I expect to see you back reeeaaal soon,
    heh, heh!'
  - 'Oooh! Yep, that''s gold I smell! And from the smell of it, it''s pretty close
    too! So ehh... Kiddo, I hope- or, ehhmm, I assume you''re smart enough to know
    what that means.


    Ehhhhhh... You, eh, do, right...? *ehem* Well, it ehh...
    It means it''s very close to one of the entrances to the facility. The main entrance.
    The fire exit. Could be either one. I''m, ehh... not sure... Sorry...


    Ehh-
    but! It means that, if ya get going, you''ll have little trouble findin'' it!
    So, my scrappin'' little employee... I''d wish you luck, but I don''t think ya
    need it, heh heh heh heh heh!'
  - '*sni-iff* Hmmmm. That''s a-promisin''. Young''in, I''ll keep this just as brief
    as the distance between the gold and the entrance to the facility... You won''t
    have to look far, so collect it and become a star! Ehe heh heh heh heh!'
  - '*sniff* *sniff*


    Hrm... *sniiiiff* *sniffsniff* There''s certainly something,
    but... smells like it''s a whole pilgrimage away. Not remotely close to any entrance
    or exit, so it''s not scorin'' any points on that, either...


    But, ehhh,
    hehe... that reminds me of one time I really did travel for days. And for my
    lovely wife, no less. See, the job that we worked at wanted her to transfer to
    a whole different country, and this was back when transport wasn''t as hypertechnermalogimecal
    as they-


    Ehmm, wait, story for another time. If the gold''s that far away
    you''re better off searchin'' for it than listenin'' to me ramble, so get going,
    young''in!'
  - '*sniff* Hrm. Ehhh... Give- give me a moment, please...


    *sniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiffffffffffffffffff-*
    Hrmgk- Blegh! *cough* *cough* *cough* Ah! *ehem* Eh, I''m- I''m- *cough* I''m
    sorry! I''m sorry this old body is, ehh... is so slow.


    I''m... ehhh- *cough*
    I''m smelling gold, that I can tell you. But... it''s- *ehem* it''s far away.
    Far from any entrance to that fearful facility. So... Ehhhh... I recommend you
    get going, ehh...


    Again, I am sorry this old body is so... ehh, so worthless.
    *ehhhem* Yeah, just... Just go. Allow me some rest...'
  - '*sniff* *sniff* *sniff* Hm. That''s a scent so faint, ya might as well not think
    it''s there. Young''in, there''s gold, but far, faarrr away. Ya gotta pack your
    stuff and prep your stuff if ya wanna find it before the end of the day.


    Ehhh...
    Ehm, oh! Ya might be able to use one of them teleporters! Ya know, the eh...
    the one to go in. All of you young''ins can save yourself some time getting TO
    it, maybe.


    Oh! Oh! And then, once you ehh...  Once you got it. Try to take
    one of those tickets with ya. The one that lets you then teleport back with that
    gold still in hand!


    Ehh... *ehem* That''s enough out of me, heh heh...
    Maybe ya don''t appreciate it when someone older than you tells ya what to do,
    heh heh...


    You know, I used to be like that. This was long ago, however...
    I, ehhh... I don''t know... I was young and stubborn. This was back when my nose
    was just developin'' too, and... Eh? Leaving? Yeah, that''s... That''s okay...'
  - 'Hm? Wait... Kiddo! This planet''s not even got any normal scrap. Whaddaya thinkin''
    asking for my help?! Or, ehhh... did you just want to talk to me? In that case,
    ehhhhh... I''m sorry...


    But, eh, well.........


    I ehh... don''t know
    what to say... Sorry for my outburst just now. I just... Ehhh... This is the
    only thing I really got. I try to- eh... I really want to help, at my old age.
    But, you know... Not much I can do...


    Ehhh again, I''m sorry. This conversation
    is dragged through the mud now so, ehhh... Just go. Sorry...'
  - '*sniff* *sniff* Ah, this the company buildin''? It doesn''t smell of any gold
    here, but I''d never forget that rot- ehh- *ehem* I''d, ehh... I''d never forget
    that smell.


    Seein'' all this reminds me of all the teams I''ve worked with...
    All the co-workers that have come and gone. Some of whom, eh... Went out too
    soon.


    So ehh, listen, young''in! Don''t blow your candle out too soon now,
    ya hear me? Maybe you''re rollin'' in cash after sellin'' all your stuff, but
    that don''t make ya invincible! Eheh, heh heh, imagine... *ehem* Now... ta-ta!'
