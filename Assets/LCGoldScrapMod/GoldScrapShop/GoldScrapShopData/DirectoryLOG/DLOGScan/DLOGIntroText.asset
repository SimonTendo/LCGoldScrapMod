  - 'Grrmmhhah- huh? Whozzat? Oh, it- it''s you. Sorry, I was just... gettin'' some
    shut-eye for a moment, that''s all, my apologies.


    ...Hm? Wait, what...?
    What''s that? Ya wanna know about mold? Pfeh! Pfeh heh! Why in the galaxy would
    you wanna know about that stinkin'' fox-infested shrubbery?


    Eh...? Ohh,
    gold! Sorry, sorry, so sorry, my hearin''''s not what it used to be. Ehhm, so,
    eh... yes, let''s just get to smellin'' gold then, heh heh...'
  - 'Oh... it''s you...


    You know, I was really hoping you wouldn''t show up,
    I''m just not, eh... not feeling like it, today.


    I keep having this weird
    hazy feeling, like I can''t feel my limbs. It''s a scary feeling, and... and...
    I wish I knew what''s wrong. It hurts, yet also doesn''t feel like anything.
    As if no more blood''s pumpin'' through this old body. And- and... ehhh... I
    wish they''d... they''d let me see a doctor already...


    Uhh- *ehem*, anyways.
    Let''s... Let''s just see what we have already...'
  - 'Ah, hi! Hi! Heh, heh. Couldn''t leave this old man collecting dust now, could
    ya? Hehehe!


    Well, good, because you should know, this nose is still the
    best at this side of space, and I''ll prove just how much it can follow that
    scent of gold... Just leave it to me, heh heh heh!'
  - 'Hm? Who- what? Jeanette, am I back? Hehh, oh, wait, just an employee. Eheh,
    sorry, foggy brain of mine starts imagining things, heh heh...


    Ehh anyways,
    what can I do for ya, young''in? Wait- no, allow me to ehh, guess... You... You
    came here... To me... To know aboouuut... Gold!


    Eh? Eh, am I right? Eh
    heh heh, see? This old fart does more than just imagine things, I can make myself
    useful, just you wait and see! Because if it''s gold you''re after, I can sense
    ''em like no other. I proverbially and literally have a nose for it, ehe heh,
    heh... Hehhhh...'
  - 'Clockin'' in for the day, heh? Eh heh, good to see ya so full o'' beans, kiddo,
    reminds me of my own days at the company.


    See, there was this one time...
    All the bunkbeds on the ship? Full. Every ehh, every single one of ''em. So some
    of us slept at a little safe spaceport nearby. We''d land the ship there and
    prep a little company-mandated takeout meal.


    Sounds strange, heh? "Mandated
    takeout"? Eh heh heh, if you ever think making instant noodles is sad, just wait
    till your boss tells ya to take ''em into the office and work late. Heh heh heh,
    that''ll instill a new level of depravity into ya, heh heh heh heh heh!


    Now,
    where was I? Ehhh, oh yeah, the bunkbeds. So, we landed the ship and ehh- what''s
    that? I was talking about gold? I, ehh... don''t... remember? Was I talking about
    gold? Ahhh eh, I must have gotten side -tracked. I''m so sorry, at my age you
    tend to forget these things. So, ehh... gold...'
  - 'Hmmm... Hm? Eh? Sorry, can I help you? Ehhh... "dlog"? Eh... ah, ah! Oh, sorry!
    I ehhm... Oh my... I- I completely forgot about- about why I''m here... Eheh...
    Heh, heh, funny, isn''t it? Heheh, that- heh, that at my age, you go forgettin''
    what your purpose is? Heh heh heh, hehhh... Hmmm...


    Eh- ermm- *ehem* A-
    anyways, ya kiddo''s wanna know about gold. That''s the point of your bein''
    here. So! Lemme do some of my patented smellin'', so that company doesn''t treat
    ya like dirt. Now, here goes! Heheh...'
  - 'Heeheeheeheehee! Another day of smellin'' gold, is it? Ehhheheheheh- I must
    say, I am likin'' that you rely on me, kiddo! Feels like it de-ages the wrinkles
    right outta this stinky schnoz!


    Ah, eheh- ya know what I just thought of?
    Those, ehhh, those butler guys. Heheh, know the ones? Heh, if ya do, you might
    already be wettin'' yourself at the thought of that freak, aren''t ya? Ehhheheheeheeee!


    Ehh...
    heh heh. *ehem* Anyways, what I wanted to say was... Those guys... They, ehh...
    They got quite a schnoz too, now, heh? Ya think they smell fear? Think they can
    sense the nerves of any interns that can''t find their co-workers? Eheh, heh...
    Hehhh...


    Oh, oh dear... That, ehm... That''s not a scenario that might,
    ehhh... End too well, I suppose... If they''re just interns, they don''t deserve
    havin'' their candle blown out too soon...


    Ehhh, so ehm, anyways. Gold!
    You were askin'' for it, and I can help ya find it! Just, ehh... just watch out
    for those freaks. Now- *ehem* Let''s smell it...'
  - '*snuuufffffff...* *snooooof...* *snuuuuuuffffffff...* *snoooooooooff...* Ehhhh,
    that''s better.


    Hm? What I was doing? Heh heh, warmin'' up, of course!
    What? Ya think this nasty nose can just smell on a whim? Hehe, no no, kiddo!
    Just like singers, I gotta do some vocal exercises, but for my nostrils.


    This
    smeller''s the best in the galaxy when it comes to sensin'' gold, but I gotta
    work for it too, heheh! Hehhh... Ahh, it- ehh... It is a bit exhausting, however.
    Which is why I told ya I can do this smellin'' only once every day.


    Egh,
    I mean- You don''t wanna hear an old man complain. You wanna know about gold.
    So! Let''s know what this planet''s hidin''...'
  - 'Eh, hrm- Ahhhh... Good mornin'', kiddo. Ready for another day of salvagin''
    for garbage? Another day of puttin'' your life on the line for a corporate entity
    ya''d rather avoid like the plague? Another day where ya might end up cryin''
    just as much you''ll end up laughin''?


    Ehhh... Hm? You are? Pfeh! Pfeh
    heh heh heh! Kiddo, you''ve got more backbone than I gave ya credit for! Heeheehee,
    I love it!


    Okay then, well- *ehem* I''ll get to work posthaste too then!
    Can''t have you young''ins beat me, now, can I? Heeehehehehe!'
  - '*sniff* Eh- heh, heh, I can already faintly smell some scrap out there, hehe.
    Ya know, young''in, it''s weird... Despite how good my nose for gold was, regular
    scrap I only barely got good at smellin'', hehehe...


    Ehhhh... Eh, maybe
    it''s the material... Well- eh, you know. Gold''s all made... well, out of gold.
    That''s all the same. But that normal scrap, ehhhhhh... Metal, wood, plastic,
    rubber, fabrics... It''s all over the place.


    Maybe, ehh... But, maybe that''s
    just an excuse I''d like to believe. Something I can tell the company, should
    they ever come knocking down my door, asking me to get a nose for metal too.
    Or a nose for plastic.


    Egh, gross, a "nose for plastic". Not somethin''
    I wanna imagine... Ehh- *ehem* So! Let''s not start imaginin'' that, shall we?
    We''ve got gold to have a nose for! Eheheh, hehhhh...'
