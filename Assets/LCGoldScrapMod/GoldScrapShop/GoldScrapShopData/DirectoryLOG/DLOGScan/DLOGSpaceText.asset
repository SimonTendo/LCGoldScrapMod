  - "Ya know, I used to be quite the stargazer, back in my day. \n\nHad all the interns
    sittin' around me like small children, gazing up at me as I told my stories about
    the stars with just as much wonder and curiosity as I did looking up at the stars
    myself.\n\nOhh, I spun stories of constellations and romance, northern lights
    and bewonderment, meteors and sadness... Ahh, they were things that made their
    faces glow with excitement, I tell ya.\n\nWell, if I could see their faces through
    the helmets, that is. Maybe they were bored out of their wits. Or asleep.\n\nAnd
    if I could see the stars too, to be honest. Spaceship of ours didn't come with
    any fancy windows like the new-fangled ones. And we weren't allowed to stay on
    the planet for too long to \"minimize damage to proprietary hardware\".\n\nYou
    know how often I've had to hear that auto-pilot computer say that? Four-hundred
    and fifty-eight times! Yeahh heh heh, this old man not only stuck around while
    those stinkin' dogs were breathing down my neck, but also for more quotas than
    anyone could wave a stick at!\n\nCost me a few coworkers, though... Ah, ehm,
    well... I'm sure they found some magic space door or whatever that everyone's
    ravin' about lately.\n\nUnless that's just a fairy tale. Poor lads..."
  - 'I enjoy watching you young''ins bumbling about each day, tryin'' to get enough
    questionable junk to make the next quota. Reminds me of the folk I used to work
    with.


    Now those were the times. We''d all lay out strategies and divide
    roles and go to the company building for a day to buy supplies so we wouldn''t
    have to waste time waitin'' around for that dropship while time was ticking.
    Truly the times...


    I miss those times, you know. And I regret not having
    said my thanks to those people when I had the chance. Seems young people don''t
    get that, for some reason. They live a bit too much in the moment.


    Don''t
    think the things you appreciate today are self-evident, you hear? Any one of
    your friends might be gone tomorrow, whether because life might get too busy
    for ''em, or through a freak accident or due to things in their brain that keep
    cookin'' and cookin'' until they... well, you know...


    So say thanks every
    once in a while. Not just to the people you say it to routinely. To all of ''em.
    And say it like you mean it. Before it''s too late.'
  - 'Ah, hi. I- I ehh... well, there''s not much you can do, at my age. You start
    feeling stuck.


    ...I, ehh... I read the paper today, said something about
    moles, I believe. Can''t ehh... remember quite clearly. It was interesting, though.
    Very interesting, yeah...


    How was today? Short, I bet. More scrap than
    you had time for, heh... Heh heh, yeah, time ehh... time never stops, does it?


    ...


    ...


    Do
    you ehhh... remember when your grandparents passed away? I do. I ehm... I mourned.
    Probably a bit too long, to be honest.


    I always thought it''d never happen
    to me, getting old. And yet, here we are... And the worst thing of all is that
    I can''t even remember how I got here. Like my life all happened in a day and
    someone won''t let me mourn what I''ve lost along the way.


    ...


    Time
    really never stops, does it...?'
  - "*snifgrk-* Egh, ow! Ow, ow, ow! I got- something in my nose, ehhh... Ahhh, eh,
    hrmngh, ow... \n\nMust have been a locust or something... Egh... I'm-... Eh...
    I'm sorry you had to see that. I don't mean to be so helpless at this old age,
    I just... My body doesn't cooperate anymore...\n\nMy own grandpa, he uhh... he
    was in a hospital once. His body was just... nearing his end. Had a buzzer to
    call the nurses to his room, should anything be wrong. But when my uncle once
    visited him, he said the nurses were on strike. And ehhh... he thought it was
    just a joke. Just a joke from an old man.\n\nBut the next day, I heard from my
    father that... That grandfather needed to use the bathroom in the middle of the
    night. Rang the buzzer, nobody showed. So he ehhh... he struggled his way there,
    using his walker. And he used the bathroom, all well and good.\n\nThe problem
    however, was getting up again. He... couldn't. Fell over. Pants still down. Bowels
    still... active. Rang the buzzer again, nobody showed. Again. Nobody showed.
    He lay on the floor all night, in his own... Ehm... He, uh... He cried all night.\n\nIt
    wasn't until my father visited the next morning that he was found. I wasn't there
    with him, but... I can only imagine the misery my grandpa must have been in.
    And only then did they consider checking if the buzzer worked..."
  - 'Ahhhh... Relaxin'', isn''t it? Out here in space there''s no Coil-heads to worry
    about. No paranoia to get your adrenaline rushin''. Not a worry in the world...
    Well, ehh... except for what the next day might bring...


    I''m... ehhh...
    Can I ask you something? Are you young''ins, ehhh... are you good with failure?
    I''m asking because... well... back in my day, I wasn''t... Used to let the stress
    get to my head... I mean, ehhh... Yeah...


    What I mean is... I started getting
    good at this scrap-collecting thing, after a while... And, ehh... Well, it was
    fun, at first. And I always had a bit of a strong sense of smell, heh. Which-
    well, heh heh, unless they were referrin'' to how sweaty I got in those old suits,
    eehehehehe! Heh, heh, heh. Heh...


    But, ehh... yeah. Soon as that "nose
    for gold"-thing started spreading, I... Ehhh... Well, I ehh... I got scared,
    I guess. I started thinking people would only see value in me if I kept deliverin''
    and deliverin'' and deliverin''. I set my standard so high- and managed to meet
    those standards, mind you... But... My standards were so high I started suffering
    from it.


    Erm... I... I don''t fully know what I''m trying to say here,
    but... If there''s something you gotta get better at, then... Then get better
    at it. Try your best to really improve. But, ehh, if you''re pushin'' yourself
    too hard, the pain will only be greater than the gain.


    I don''t wanna see
    you collapse, kid, so... Take your rest. Please.

    ...Pinky promise?'
  - 'Ahh, hello there, young''in! How was your day? I, ehhh, I hope it was a good
    day for ya, heh heh heh. Hope you didn''t lose any colleagues out there in the
    field... Or managed to get a good harvest of scrap, now. Ehhhh... But it''s nice,
    right? Bein'' asked how you''re doin'' every once in a while.


    Lemme tell
    ya, I had one co-worker once. Guy was as quiet as a brick. Really good at his
    job, but always ran ahead without sayin'' much to the rest of us. We managed
    to get a reaction out of him every once in a while, but even on the ship, he,
    ehhh... he usually stayed on one side of the ship, while the rest of us would
    be chatting near the bunkbeds.


    Now... there was this one other colleague...
    He didn''t like the guy. At all, eheh heh. Thought his being quiet was somehow
    insultin''. Tried to force him to agree with his plans. But... ehh, that only
    drove him further away from us. We managed to make it through another week together,
    but the air was tense...


    Then, heh... Then that guy who didn''t like the
    guy, heh heh heh... Guy got picked up by his parents. Didn''t like the job anymore.
    And you know what the quiet guy then said? He, ehhh... *ehem* He said, "Phew.
    He was really driving us apart."


    Heh, hehehe, turns out quiet guy already
    saw us as a pretty tight-knit group, hehe! And you know what? He was completely
    right! Eeheeheeheehee! We worked great together! It, ehhhh... It showed me somethin'',
    young''in. Ehh... Well, first, it taught me that the guiet guy just wanted some
    peace and quiet.


    But it also taught me that not everybody in a group needs
    to be a party-popper in order to be part of that group. Ya don''t gotta... "fit
    in", or- ehh, or "force them into the group". Ya gotta get along! No need to
    create illusions of grand friendships. Just... appreciate each other''s company,
    and respect boundaries anyone might set, eheheheh...


    So, ehh... who knows.
    Maybe you''ve been sittin'' on a quiet guy too, who thinks of you as a real friend.
    Heh! Heh! Heh!'
  - "Zzzzzzzzmmmmrrrg- hm? Wh- who's there...? Ah, it's just you, kiddo. Apologies,
    I... ehhh... tend to drift off. And not ehh... not just recently, but... for
    a longer time. But, ehhhngh-! Ahhhhh... Think I'm startin' to wake up slowly.
    Time to do some smellin', is it?\n\n\n*sniff* *sniff* Hm? But, wait... Ah, ah
    heheheh, we're in space. Eheh ehhhh, sorry, sorry... I ehh... didn't notice.
    Reaction time's slowin' down at my old age, ya know? Eh heh heh!\n\nBut I must
    say, kiddo's... Your ship's not smellin' half-bad. This nose is more attuned
    to gold- ehh... because it, ehh, all smells the same, you know? Heheh...\n\nBut
    I mean ehh, your ship smells ehhhh... positive. I can't very well smell if you
    got much other scrap collected, or if it's just a general good vibe you young'ins
    all radiate around each other... But I like it! Ehheheheh!\n\n\nEhhhh... You
    know, that- erm... It's good to see you gettin' along so well. Makes an old man
    feel less lonely, hehh... Ehhhh... You know, speakin' of loneliness, ehhh...
    Eh, I hope this is a fun topic to talk about...\n\nBut ehhrm... My wife. She,
    ehh... she's the kindest, most beautiful woman I know. And- ahhh, the fun we
    had... We could talk for hours. She always managed to get the brightest laughs
    out of the both us, ehehehe. Heh... I think I got my laugh from her, heh heh...\n\nShe,
    ehh... She was always caring. We met at an old job of mine, at a retail store. 
    She worked the cash register, I worked in the stockroom in the back, movin' boxes
    around. We only started talkin' because she came up to me, heh heh... I would've
    never dared to make the first move...\n\nAnd ehh... I can't... I don't know when
    I'll get to see her again... I miss her... I've been at this job so long, I...
    ehhh, I don't know how long... \n\nErm, hey, kiddo... Can you do me a favor and,
    ehhh... see if ya can get the company to contact her somehow. Tell her, eh...
    tell her I'm in good hands now... With you kids."
  - "Ehh.. you know, kiddo... Call me biased because of the whole \"nose for gold\"
    nickname, but, ehhh... That gold's pretty useful, ya know. Not just for sellin',
    either. No ehh, heheh- you can actually get a fair use outta some of these items.
    \n\nFor example, ehhhh... there's that one, ehh... oh, what was it? I believe
    it was a golden sun? No, erm... gold stun? Ehhh, well- that thing's actually
    reusable! I think... I believe I remember some rowdy interns tossin' it around
    like a beach ball. Had to cover my ears threefold in order to block out the ringin',
    I tell ya...\n\nOr ehh... the gold flashlight! Sure the thing's brighter than
    the sun in the sky, but inside the facility? Heheh, no corner of the room is
    invisible with that thing in your hands, heh heh heh!\n\nHehhh... and, well,
    erm... Of course, all of them bein' made of gold and bein' conductive and all
    that... Makes them more difficult to retrieve, ya know... And with how heavy
    they are and ehh, on and on...\n\nBut, young'in, trust me. Put some faith in
    the gold you find, and the gold will treat ya just as well in return. That's
    a promise from this old man to you! Eeheheheheh!"
  - 'Heh, ehehehe.. Eeheeheeheehee! Eh, eheh- Ah! My, ehheheh... My apologies...
    It''s just... I remembered one time, eh heh heh...


    There was ehh... there
    was one time. See, we ehh... we actually overdelivered. And ehh, heh, I mean,
    we really overdelivered. The overtime bonus we got was almost humbling, eheh
    heh! Almost... Eheheheh!


    But, ehehehh... *ehem* You see... I notice how
    it''s easy for you young''ins to get caught in the moment. Swept away by your
    emotions. Either out of a scare ya got from a monster. Or because ya got in a
    fight with one of your co-workers. It ehh... it all happens.


    But... And,
    I must say, we got into silly little bouts like that too, mind you, heheh...
    But... What I mean to say is...


    One week... we had some emotional moments
    like that in the last week before that. And we only barely made quota that week.
    We all knew that behind those lifeless helmets we were scared out of our wits
    as to not makin'' the next quota.


    So, the next quota... We didn''t fight.
    We didn''t get along all happy and sappy either, mind you, heh heh. But... we
    just concentrated, made a plan of attack, went into that blasted facility, didn''t
    let our fears get the better of us, and got as much scrap as we could.


    And,
    kiddo, lemme tell ya... We were rolling in it! Could barely walk around the ship
    thanks to all the items we managed to collect! We had to put all the gold in
    a shadowy corner because the light kept reflectin'' into our blasted eyes, eeheheheheh!


    And
    then we decided to sell it. All of it. We got that major overtime bonus, and
    we, ehhh... We just laughed! Eeheehee! Laughed about how just one week prior
    we had a silly argument, while now we were practically employees of the week,
    eheh heh heh heh heh heh!


    So, ehh... You young''ins can do that too, I
    believe you can! Just try, for one quota, to put your fears, your angers, your
    whatallyamahaveit''s aside, and try to show that company what you''re worth!
    You''ll have some nice spending cash after that, I assure you! Ehehe!


    Heh
    heh... Hm? What our fight was about? Ehhh, heh heh. Let''s just say... I was
    known for smellin'', yeah? But eh... that week, I made my co-workers do some
    smellin'' too, alright, eeheeheheheh!'
  - 'Say, ehh... kiddo. Can I ask ya a favor? What''s you''re opinion of me? Old?
    Decrepit? Talks more than he should? Annoying...? Ehhh, I... I wouldn''t blame
    you...


    You know, I... Hehh... I''m aware of my shortcomings... Or... I
    suppose you could call them overcomings, in a sense. How I always talk too much,
    try to help too much, try to deliver more than I can... And, ehh... maybe, because
    of that... I actually don''t help at all... I talk too much and tell too little...
    and deliver nothing of value at all...


    Ehm... In that case, I- ehh... I''m
    sorry. I- I really am... I''m trying to help you, but, my head...


    Hehhhh,
    it would all be a poor excuse anyway... I''m- just... I''m sorry, kid...'
  - 'Ah! *ehem* Hello! Hello... I don''t believe we''ve been properly introduced
    to each other, eh? Well, as for me, I''m what the company''s come to refer to
    as the, ehh... the "Directory-LOG", was it? That''s a, ehhh... a bit of a corporate
    way of referrin'' to a decrepit, retired old man like me, eh? Even my nicknames
    back in the day were less crude than that! Heh, heh, heh!


    Ehh... Maybe
    that''s not a very fun introduction, now ehh, is it? Eheh heh. But! I promise
    to you. What the company''s said about my... I believe they use the term "nose
    for gold"? Eheh, leave it up to them to think of a cute name for somethin'' they
    just wanna exploit to get as much garbage as possible, eh? Eeheheheheh!


    Hehhh...
    What was I, ehh... Oh yeah! My nose. Erm, sorry about that... I tend to get sidetracked,
    as you might be able to tell, heh heh... *ehem* What I mean to say is, my nose
    for gold is as genuine as the company told ya in the sales pitch. You want a
    pointer to the gold on a planet, you young''ins come bumblin'' to me, ya hear?
    Ehehehehe!


    But, I''m, eh... I''m no psychic, so I can''t tell you, erm...
    Every, single little detail. But I promise to you. I can smell their amount,
    their worth, size, and even how far away they are. Heh, it''s- ehh... it''s true!
    Just type whatever ya just typed into your fancy computer while on a planet,
    and I can tell ya all ya want to know.


    Only thing I can''t do is... Ehhhh,
    I guess "re-smell", you could call it, heh heh. I can give you kiddo''s advice
    once per day, and you can read it back all day long. But when we take to space
    again, I can''t promise I won''t go ramblin'' again, eeheeheheheh! And the next
    day I''ll do whatever smellin'' ya want of me, you can count on me!


    Speakin''
    of ramblin''... Wanna hear a little story right now? Heh heh, I promise it''s
    a short one, truly! So, ehm... back when I worked in this job. We actually saw
    the gold discovery happenin'', hehe, we witnessed it! We were a bit confused,
    but that company was as laser-focused on gettin'' us in shape as the sharp edge
    of a pickaxe. Hehe, and... ehhh... I can promise ya that I''ve got plenty of
    stories like that too.


    So! Come to me for help, for stories of the olden
    days, and for keepin'' this old lost schnoz some company too, eeheheheheh! Heh
    heh. Hheehhhh...'
