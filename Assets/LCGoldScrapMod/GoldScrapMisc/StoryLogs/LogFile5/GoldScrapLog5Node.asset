    the will of the spirits that a fortune-teller such as I finds herself working
    hard labor, yet one cannot help but wonder if this is not some challenge imposed
    onto me by fate. Thankfully, the spirits guide me and my fellow wandering souls
    as we explore these confines of space, allowing us much prosperity indeed.\n\nThe
    spirits even reveal to me constellations that hold the secrets of this universe's
    ruling powers. Powers that celebrate joyous occassions and powers that reap this
    world's bounties. Powers that form what we see and collect on our journeys, as
    they try to guide us down paths of fortune or malice.\n\nAlas, it appears I have
    no way of drawing upon these secrets for myself, so I shall take note of these
    constellations for future generations, to allow them to learn from knowledge
    of the past...\n\n\n\n\"When celebrating freedom, monsters are repelled,\nbut
    in the week of death, they cannot be withheld.\n\nOn time's passage, the spirits
    warn to combust,\n\rand at the honor of arts, fortune shall be robust.\n\nDays
    of anniversaries, turn the world to gold,\nwhilst the day of jests, leaves that
    story untold.\n\nBut the most loving occassions, reveal for free,\na constellation,
    forming nine-seven-five-three...\"\n\n\n===\n\nPerformance: Above expectations\nConsequence:
