    Captain''s Log, this is your captain speaking. Star Date, fifteen
    o'' five. Position of the Sun, blasting out over the horizon.

    I always wanted
    to say that. Anyways, this is the log of /\\/\//\/\/. Here I''ll log the gold
    we find, as the voice on the phone yelled at us to do.


    2 quotas, Assurance
    through March: 2 items, $176. We suspect later moons hold more valuable gold,
    given the mining activities and developed civilizations found there.


    2
    quotas, Rend and Dine: 5 items, $494. Seems like our hunch was right. We''re
    going to Titan and Artifice next, seeing as those moons were rich with mining
    activities.


    Get ready... After 2 quotas on the above planets... We found
    22 gold items worth $2797! Now that''s more like it! Then again, it''s not that
    difficult to find the stuff if it reeks like that, whoowee!!


    /\/\\/\//\/\/\/


    Today
    we discovered something about that device we have to test. If you tap a cave
    wall with the flat part, it will create a metal-detector-esque sound that leads
    you straight to gold, which, eh... is incredible!

    I heard a talented young
    lady at Embrion is responsible for its creation, and I''m sure she put that in
    there to help us all survive these quotas.

    Makes an old guy proud... seeing
    these youngsters come up with such ingenious solutions...

    This
    new team I''ve been working with for a while has been ehh... acting strange.
    The... The rumors about my ability to find gold have been spreading, but, ever
    since they heard the company microphone say something about bringing it... eh...
    something, it seems like they''ve been watching me.

    They suddenly bought
    a lot of shovels. And a zap gun too, despite being too afraid to fight any monsters,
    hehe. And... I''m sometimes awoken by them pacing around the spaceport at night...

    I
    don''t know what it is they''re planning, but at least I''m almost at the age
    where I''ll get to leave this bloomin'' business... Ehhh, hopefully forever.
