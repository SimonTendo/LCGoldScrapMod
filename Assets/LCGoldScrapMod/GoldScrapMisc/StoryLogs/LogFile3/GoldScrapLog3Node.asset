    Hello. This
    is my log.


    Our "captain" already keeps a log, but that demented bastard
    probably just writes shopping lists... and then forgets what he wrote on them
    anyways, pfah! So I''m keeping a log to make up for all of us, including the
    quiet moron who can''t take a joke. Dude''s probably born stupid.


    Today
    we found a big haul of gold. The "captain" is usually the one to find it first,
    so he''s probably just full of himself. And they keep saying their success is
    thanks to that stupid statue of a whatever. A tiger, or something. Worship it
    like a cult already. I swear, these people.


    We found more gold, but we
    keep going to bloody [REDACTED]. I tried to get quiet guy on my side about going
    to Offense, I always wanted to go there. But of course the dude''s vocal chords
    were cut off at birth. So now we keep going to hell incarnate, where the dogs
    breathe down your neck. "Captain" says he''s fine with it. Psychopath.


    I
    suggested going elsewhere to find gold. We found some today, but I don''t wanna
    get myself killed dammit. I swear, I''m gonna get my parents to sue these people.
    Now we''re going to Experimentation. Like I''m a damned baby.


    Found out
    something cool about that stupid """undisclosed device""": it can slam into doors
    - like waPOW!! I think I can probably jam the two pointy bits into locks to force
    them open. Maybe these buffoons will finally respect me then. So stupid I can''t
    just call it a [REDACTED] like it CLEARLY IS!!!


    These dumbasses won''t
    even listen to me. I swear, my parents are gonna make them go through legal hell
    so hard. I''m like practically made for this job, they just put me up with these
    damn [REDACTED]. I''m forcing the ship to Offense tomorrow, and then calling
    my parents once we get back in space. Ugh. Worst summer job ever.
