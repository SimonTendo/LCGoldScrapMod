    compliance with the Company's new mandatory GoldLog policy, I, the captain of
    a team of 3 people, will hereby keep notes of our findings in regards to the
    gold found during our expeditions.\r\n\r\nOctober 9th\r\nWe did not find any
    gold at Experimentation. We suspect that more gold appears on moons that are
    dangerous, and less on moons that are safer.\r\n\r\nOctober 12th\r\nWe found
    gold: a gold vat full of chemicals at Vow. As the rumors have stated, the gold
    is indeed very valuable but also much heavier. The high monetary value compensates
    for the high weight, but undeniably makes retrieving the item difficult.\r\n\r\nOctober
    17th\r\nToday we found gold during a thunderstorm. Here we learned the danger
    of gold's conductivity, as all of it will be targeted by lightning, further increasing
    the challenge of retrieving it.\n\nOctober 19th\nWe found several golden items
    during another thunderstorm. However, one of my crewmates had the idea to have
    the undisclosed device hold onto the gold, so it can quickly be dropped at a
    safe distance once targeted by lightning.\nThis method has greatly relieved our
    stresses, and I will use this positive note to take it a little easier myself,
    as I trust in the expertise and experience of my crewmates.\r\n\r\nthe captiaan
