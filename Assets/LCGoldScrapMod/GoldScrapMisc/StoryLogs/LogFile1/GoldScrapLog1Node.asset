    hey companyyyy
    hiiiiiiii. spying on a girl''s privacy by reading through her diary now huh?
    tut tut. that''s poor form even for you... buuut I''ll let it slide this time
    because, really, where would you be without me and my inventions? ;3

    first
    you forced me to hand over the solution that finally solves your dumb teleportation
    problem, then I wasn''t allowed to keep time-magic all to myself, boohoo, and
    now you''re calling my pride and joy some "undisclosed device" that everyone
    needs to do test runs with. but you know that without me all those interns would
    be tripping right off of cliffs, like that Offense guy haha.


    dear mandatory
    diary, today I found no gold, yeah so anyways *ohmigosh those robots*, I love
    being able to study them all day long!! I guess giving you my creations at least
    lets me work without a quota so I can just sit here and scavengggge all day long.
    and then I can tinkerrrr all night long, and then I can regretttt not getting
    enough sleep the next dayyyy xZ


    there was an eclipse today! i LOOVE seeing
    all those robots in action! and it''s sooooo satisfying watching them blast those
    monsters to smithereens. I errr... did stay back in the ship thoo. they might
    be cute and full of rad tech, but they can also burn my skin to a crisp if they
    so please :P


    I think I spotted some sort of... mole...? today? he didn''t
    notice me tho, he just kinda stared around blankly. maybe he knew there wasn''t
    any gold on this devoid-of-life planet, as I couldnt find squat either


    again
    didn''t get any gold and this diary thing is keeping me away from my experiments,
    so I''ll just leave it for someone else to find. and here''s a tip for you on
    my "undisclosed device": if you got this diary using a ladder or jetpack, then
    good on you but you''re doing it wrong.

    you gotta use my device to PFEEEEEWWWW
    yourself into the sky! it''s amazinggg!! careful you don''t land on a lower surface
    than where you started tho, cuz that''s gonna cost you your ankles

    but yeah
    anyways have funnnnn byyeeeee ^v^

    Performance: Helpful

    Consequence:
    Think of branding for device
